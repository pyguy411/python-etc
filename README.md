# python-etc

# Mostly python3 and then some other tech tossed in
## little goodies of code for
- proof of concept, 
- demo purposes 
- quick reference.

examples of:
- django projects
- google app engine projects
- scripts
- pypi
- editor configs and opinions
    - vscode
    - sublime text 3
    - pycharm
    - vim

- also some markdown references.  
this repo is a new work in progress, what you see listed above may not exist yet.

## some philosophy
after you read this, google PEP8 and put under your pillow.

#### The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
of course, it would not be much of a python tips page without mentioning the 
*"Zen of Python"*, which really embodies the philosophy of this language.

    python -c "import this"

results in (as your skills improve, this makes more and more sense)

> Beautiful is better than ugly.  
> Explicit is better than implicit.  
> Simple is better than complex.  
> Complex is better than complicated.  
> Flat is better than nested.  
> Sparse is better than dense.  
> Readability counts.  
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
> Although practicality beats purity.  
> Errors should never pass silently.  
> Unless explicitly silenced.  
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
> Now is better than never.  
> Although never is often better than *right* now.  
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!  

As you develop your skills, you will find yourself finding the above to become
more true as time goes by.

my interpretation of it is simply:
>If you start working on a project and it does something consistently 
but without real cause, stop doing it!  especially if that consistency is 
expensive. however, don't just make that decision if you are on a team.
there could be valid reasons for why that consistency exists; in that case, 
try to learn from the folks why it is that way and ask the questin to the team
"how could we do this better?"
